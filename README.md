Contains the following:
- SBB Type L Signal definitions (possibly incomplete)
- JMRI Layout with Simple Signal Logic (SSL) definitions
  -- SSL uses signal heads
- JMRI Layout with Signal Mast Logic
  -- SML uses signal masts
  -- The layout uses virtual masts with the Basic model signals set with followers from the SBB Type L set.
  
It should be possible to clone this repository directly into your personal .jmri folder and access the layout panels with
